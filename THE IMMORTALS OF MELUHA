The novel, "The Immortals of Meluha", by Amish Tripathi, the first book of "The Shiva Trilogy", takes you back around 4000 years and you begin imagining the Hindu mythology' s gods. .A book that can't be kept down in between the pages,though the story goes long but every page has the ability to bring the whole picture in front of your eyes. The story has so many scientific facts that have been explained very reasonably, which I've found really astonishing. Obviously, this book has become one of the best books I've ever read.
