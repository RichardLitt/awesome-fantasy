[Sword art Online](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250192/)(2012) * by [Reki Kawahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reki_Kawahara) *rating[7.7]
Sword art Online is one of the most awesome Anime Series on VMMORPG where players get entrapped in a game. I think the concept,idea and the way the things progresses is great but it need kinda a more realistic theme rather than typical Hero-Winning Senario. At the end I guess it's all good. --[@Sourav Sharma](http://www.github.com/rockoking)
